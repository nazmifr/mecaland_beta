# CH340 USB Converter

The CH340G chip is a very low cost and low footprint USB Serial controller, it has one receiving and one transmitting pin as well as some UART control pins such as 
 - DTR
 - DCS
 - DCD
 - DSR
 - CTS
 
 This project aims at creating a simple open-source breakout implementation for 5V TTL and 3.3V devices.
 
 This board can be used to:
  - communicate with RS232 devices such as old wacom tablets, old mouses and such (drivers and level conversion (MAX232) chip needed)
  - program microcontrollers such as ESP8266, ATTINY13, ATTINY85, ATMEGA328P, ATMEGA2560
  - communicate with tty (teletype) devices such as casio and texas instruments calculators, minitel, several devices through ISP
  - communicate with a modem with the Hayes/AT command set (GSM, 3G, LTE, landline DSL)
  
  
  ## BOM
  
  ## How To
  
  ## The level conversion board for RS-232
  
  ## The calculator cable
  
  ## The 5V R232 header (might work on some devices)
  
  
  
  TODO
   - add board schematics and views
   - application specific circuits ?
   - creating a breakout board for CH340T (SPI programming)
