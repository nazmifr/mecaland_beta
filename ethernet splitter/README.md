# Open-source 10/100M Ethernet splitter

This passive splitter divides the 4 pairs in a CAT5 or CAT6 cable (100Mbps or 1Gbps) into two RJ45 Terminals for a dual input, dual output operation

- Consumes no power
- You can run two devices on a single cable, no need to modify your infrastrucutre
- Full 100M Speed on both lanes
- You can also put an active switch or router behind to increase the number of ports

Example use case: say you have a walled RJ-45 socket that's plugged to a photocopier, and that you want a PC near this printer, no need to run a new cable or buy a switch, just put one of these splitters at both ends and you can plug your pc and your photocopier at the same time.

The schematic is completely customisable and the official version comes with various lengths of cable and plug configuration

- 2F 1M 20cm soldered + 2 cables
- Bare 3F
- 3F + 1 Single Cable
- 3F + 2 Cables

  - 20cm
  - 50cm
  - 100cm
