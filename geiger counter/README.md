# Standardized open-source and free geiger counter project

This proposal aims to document the current best practices and realizations of a geiger counter and to set a standard for the realization of such devices. We thus aim to lower the cost and increase the functionality and reliability of the devices that will be created using these guidelines. We also hope to make our plans accessible to the casual electronic engineer so that production can happen everywhere in the world and the design be more refined as iterations and forks appear. Our example is the [[Reprap]] project that fostered the creation of an active and vivid maker community and of so many great replicable 3D printer designs.
