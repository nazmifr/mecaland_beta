- 5V In can be powered from an USB Power bank as well or a smartphone USB OTG cable
- True RMS 2.5W Speakers deliver fair sound thats audible and bass boosted
- AUX USB microphone INPUT takes any lavalier or desktop electret microphone with a 3.5mm jack output
- Can be built with cheap, readily available components and few tools

Version without USB


## Large scale prod

We do not think large scale production of this peculiar item would be a good idea, we very much prefer distributed production. If you want to buy a KSPK, see with one of these sellers:
