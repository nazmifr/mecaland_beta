# Simple USB A Adapters

The first device is designed to enable the user to use ports that would be inaccessible to a full length USB A Male connector.
The second one can prove very useful on a trip when you have only one charger and need to charge two devices at the same time (no fast-charge support 5V 500mA per device MAX)

They are very easy to build using just spare USB Male and Female connectors and soldering them, as every pin is inline, it's very easy and straightforward. Other configurations can also quite easily be built.

When soldered, the device is consolidated with hot glue that's kept in place with a thermically dense object such as a pair of metal pliers or a hammer to cool it quickly.

The mechanical resistance is fair, however, it is not comparable to off the shelf devices with molded connectors. Further research is needed in this area to make a more sturdy version.
