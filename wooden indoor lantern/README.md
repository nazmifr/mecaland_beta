# Simple indoor wooden lantern design
This little lantern can be built with just a laser cutter, a pvc cutter (or a hacksaw) and some basic sckills, it can be fitted with an LED, an AC or battery powered edison lamp or any other light fixture that you can think of. Be creative!

The woood wouldn't hold that long outdoors so it's really just for decoration purposes, we'll be coming with a more rugged design for your /out/ adventures pretty soon
